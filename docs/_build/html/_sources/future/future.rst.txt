DEBrowser Additions
*******************

In the future, we are going to add:

	* Venn Diagrams to compare overlapping differentially expressed genes in different condition comparison results.
	
	* Increase in the number of used clustering methods.
	
	* GO term analysis gene lists will be added for found GO categories.
	
This page will be updated as new capabilities are added to DEBrowser and/or if we begin new advancements.
